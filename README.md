# Sorting_Algorithms_in_C

This repository provides basic sorting methods for unsorted integers implmented in C.The input file a can be 
either given by user or it itself can create files as random numbers or ascending order or descending order or same numbers.

The user has to specify the count to generate numbers to generate. Those numbers will be stored in file.

Whenever we want to sort it will copy from file to array, sort them and it will send back to output file.

# Sorting Algorithms Implemented
1.Bubble sort
2.Insertion sort
3.Shell sort
4.Selection sort
5.Quick sort
6.Merge sort
7.Radix sort
8.Heap sort

# Limitations
Sorting will be done only for integers type input.

# Future works
Sorting to be done for input of other datatypes (FLOATs, CHARs, STRINGs).


# To compile the program
make

./sort
